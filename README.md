# This is my STAT 330 final project
# I created a code that can take any Gapminder CSV file and transform it so that it can be merged with an existing Gapminder dataset.
# This new dataset can display a scatterplot showcasing relationships between any two variables. 
# The majority of the code is written inside a macro for ease of modification of inputs.
